I have been working as a freelancer, remaking the exterior of the website in a few days. The client had had all main information and a simply designed website, which I had to make more attractive for users. First of all, I had offered a model of the future website and after acceptance of the customer, I have started to work with the front-end part of the website using Sass-preprocessor, Bootstrap and jQuery. Final result can be seen here: ABAL Solutions

## Hobbies and Interests:
The whole my life was dedicated to finding the sphere, in which I feel myself comfortably. I have been trying myself in innumerable spheres. However, at the moment I am highly interested only in a few of them. My first and main passion is *language-learning*. In my opinion, language is a door to another culture, new experience and knowledge. From the very childhood I was in love with **English language**, and this love has even increased since that. At the moment I am in progress of studying three absolutely new languages for me: **Spanish**, **Korean** and **Japanese**. However, my language passion did not stop only on human languages. Secondly, I am highly interested in *computer languages*, especially, which are correlated to the *Web Development sphere*. I am mostly concerned about the front-end web-development, consequently, the language knowledge is fully connected with this sphere as well: **HTML5**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and such libraries as **Bootstrap** and **jQuery**. My third passion is writing, talking deeply, *content writing*. It makes me calm and absolutely fascinated, when I feel, how smoothly and attractively words are constructing the whole paragraph, which create the perfect text.
